# Scaffolding

The structure of this module and repository was scaffolded using [PSStucco](https://github.com/jimbrig/PSStucco) by
Jimmy Briggs, who forked and improved upon the original [Stucco](https://github.com/devblackops/Stucco) module by
Brandon Olin. The Stucco module is a [Plaster Template](https://github.com/PowerShellOrg/Plaster/blob/master/docs/en-US/about_Plaster.help.md)
and if you haven't heard of Plaster yet, you might enjoy reading about it.  It's a great little PowerShell framework
which enables you to create flexible templates using an XML document.  

## Structure

### Sample Module

There is a functional DadJokes module in this repository. You can import it directly with
`Import-Module docs-workshop/docs-workshop.psd1`, or you can "build" the module by running `./build.ps1`.

| .devcontainer/                | Optional (recommended) devcontainer configuration for this workshop. Use the devcontainer locally, or using GitHub codespaces. |
| .github/workflows             | Workflow files describing when and how GitHub Actions should build the module and documentation. |
| .vscode/                      | VSCode configuration files to help normalize the development environment between different users and machines. |
| docs/                         | Source folder for markdown files and assets to be rendered into a static website. |
| docs-workshop/                | Contains the source for a sample DadJokes module. |
| Output/                       | When running `build.ps1`, the "compiled" PowerShell module will be placed here. |
| sandbox/                      | An empty folder used as a sandbox for following along during the workshop. Have fun and experiment! |
| tests/                        | Pester tests go here. There are a few, but it was not a priority for this workshop. |
| .gitattributes                | Helps ensure line endings don't become a never-ending source of senseless commits. |
